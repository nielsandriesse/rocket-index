## Rocket Index

An overview of orbital class rockets, both active and in development.

### Adding or editing a vehicle or launch provider

To add or edit a vehicle or launch provider, update the files in `src/data` and make a pull request. I'll usually be able to merge it within a few days. A couple things to keep in mind:

- Vehicles must be orbital class.
- To keep the index clean, please don't add all the variations of a given vehicle (e.g. Falcon 9 Full Thrust vs Falcon 9 Block 5).
- The vehicle must be active or in development (i.e. no retired vehicles).
